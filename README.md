# Abstract 
Network inference from time-series proteomics data remains a fundamental challenge in systems biology, with most approaches unable to distinguish direct regulatory relationships from indirect associations mediated by intermediate proteins. I present GC-Med, a computational framework that combines Granger causality testing with bootstrapped mediation analysis to construct directed causal networks representing only direct protein regulatory relationships. The method operates through a four-stage pipeline: First, it performs initial filtering to find protein pairs that vary together using Pearson correlation above a threshold, which narrows down candidate pairs for testing. Second, it performs Granger causality tests for each candidate pair to determine if past values of Protein A help predict future values of Protein B better than Protein B's history alone, establishing temporal precedence with false discovery rate correction. Third, it builds a directed network graph where proteins are represented as nodes and directed edges represent causal relationships, with edges indicating whether A positively or negatively causes changes in B. Fourth, it performs mediation analysis to determine if observed causal relationships are mediated by another variable. For instance, if A causes both B and C, and B causes C, it's possible that A's effect on C is indirect and mediated by B. In these cases, conditional Granger causality tests are performed to check if the A→C relationship becomes non-significant when controlling for B, and if so, the edge between nodes A and C is pruned. By quantifying the proportion of causal effect mediated using bootstrap confidence intervals, GC-Med provides identification of spurious edges, yielding cleaner networks that more accurately reflect direct regulatory mechanisms. This framework is applicable to time-series proteomics data from traditional high-throughput platforms and emerging wearable molecular biosensors, enabling more interpretable systems-level analysis of protein regulatory dynamics. 

# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 The Challenge of Network Inference in Proteomics
Understanding regulatory relationships among proteins is fundamental to systems biology, with applications ranging from disease mechanism elucidation to therapeutic target identification. While high-throughput proteomics technologies have enabled comprehensive measurement of protein abundance across conditions and time points, inferring the underlying regulatory network structure remains challenging. Traditional approaches based on correlation or differential expression analysis can identify co-varying proteins but cannot establish directionality or distinguish direct regulatory relationships from indirect associations [1,2].

The distinction between direct and indirect relationships is not merely academic—it has profound implications for biological interpretation. Consider a scenario where protein A regulates protein B, and protein B in turn regulates protein C (A→B→C). Standard network inference methods would typically report edges for A→B, B→C, and A→C. However, the A→C relationship is indirect, mediated entirely through B. Including such indirect edges in network representations obscures the true regulatory architecture, complicates hub identification, and can mislead downstream pathway analysis and therapeutic targeting efforts [3,4].

## 1.2 Limitations of Existing Approaches
Existing computational methods for network inference fall into several categories, each with distinct limitations for identifying direct causal relationships:
- Static correlation-based methods (including partial correlation networks and Gaussian graphical models) can identify conditional independence but lack temporal information necessary to infer directionality [5,6]. These methods fundamentally cannot distinguish cause from effect or identify mediated relationships without temporal ordering.
- Differential network analysis approaches compare networks across conditions but similarly lack causal inference capabilities [7]. While useful for identifying context-specific associations, these methods cannot determine whether observed changes represent direct regulatory mechanisms or downstream consequences.
- Bayesian network approaches can infer directed acyclic graphs and have been successfully applied to gene expression data [8,9]. However, most implementations do not explicitly test for or remove mediated edges, and the computational complexity scales poorly beyond a few hundred variables. Dynamic Bayesian networks address temporal dynamics but rarely incorporate mediation testing [10].
- Information-theoretic methods such as mutual information and transfer entropy can capture nonlinear relationships and directionality [11,12]. While powerful, these approaches require substantial amounts of data and do not provide natural frameworks for mediation analysis or statistical significance testing with multiple comparison correction.
- Granger causality, developed in econometrics and widely used in neuroscience, tests whether past values of variable X improve prediction of variable Y beyond Y's own history [13,14]. This provides a clear operational definition of causality based on temporal precedence and predictive power. However, applications to proteomics have been limited, and existing implementations do not address the problem of indirect relationships [15,16].

## 1.3 Contributions
I present GC-Med, a framework that addresses these limitations by integrating Granger causality testing with bootstrapped mediation analysis to identify and remove indirect edges from inferred protein regulatory networks. Our approach makes several key contributions:
- First, we apply Granger causality testing with false discovery rate (FDR) correction to establish temporal precedence and predictive relationships between protein pairs, providing a statistically rigorous foundation for directional edge assignment that accounts for multiple hypothesis testing.
- Second, we implement bootstrapped mediation analysis to quantify the proportion of each observed relationship that operates through intermediate proteins, enabling data-driven decisions about edge pruning rather than relying on arbitrary topology-based heuristics.
- Third, we provide a complete computational pipeline that transforms raw time-series proteomics data into pruned, directed networks suitable for systems-level analysis, with quantified uncertainty for both causal relationships and mediation effects.

The resulting framework is applicable to time-series proteomics data from traditional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry platforms, as well as emerging continuous monitoring technologies such as wearable molecular biosensors when these become available for protein measurements [17,18]. By producing networks that represent direct regulatory relationships with quantified statistical confidence, GC-Med enables more accurate identification of regulatory hubs, pathway reconstruction, and mechanistic hypothesis generation.
